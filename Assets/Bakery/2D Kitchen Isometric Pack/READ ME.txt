Hello!

There is three tile palettes for walls, floor and kitchen tables. Create more if you need for other furniture.

To create Tile Palette go to "Window" -> "2D" -> "Tile Palette". In Tile Palette window click "Create New Palette". Name it, choose Grid "Isometric Z as Y" and Cell Size "Automatic". Create and save it.

Next, drag assets you want in created Tile Palette and save it.

To create grid to draw on, in Hierarchy window click "Create" -> "2D Object" -> "Isometric Z as Y Tilemap". 

For drawing, select asset in Tile Palette, choose brush button and draw in Scene.

I choose Pixels per Unit 256 and Max Size 512 for assets, but you can change it.

To mirror asset horizontally press "{".

2D Kitchen Isometric Pack and 2D Casual Isometric Pack have the same kitchen table outer and inner corners, but other things are different and don't have same names.


If you find any mistakes in asssets (random spot on transparent background or holes) or have any questions, contact me!
